How to download(Windows Only) - Pick a version you want to download. Open the dist folder in the file and you can download from there.

After that change to the folder the python file is located such as `cd file/location` next run `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole filename.py`
After that you can do a commit to the project.

# IMPORTANT
First: The first 4 versions of KM Bot are not the best versions, a new version would be released titles as `KM-Bot 5`.
Second: You would not be able to update to the next version with the first 4 versions and would manually need to update from here.
